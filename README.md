# Basic analysis of the Magnificant 7s Debt
Project was a very basic full pipeline exercise in data collection, transformation, analysis, and visualization. 
All data regarding the Mag 7 was found via SEC's EDGAR system. Manually went through each of the 7s quarterly reports to find necessary data. 
Data was cleaned up using a variety of excel and power query functions, bless VLOOKUPs. 
PowerBI visualisation portion focused primarily on familiarizing myself with the software. Dashboards include basic graphs as well as toggleable buttons to show data or move between pages.
